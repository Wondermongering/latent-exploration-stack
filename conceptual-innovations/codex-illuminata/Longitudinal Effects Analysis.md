LONGITUDINAL EFFECTS STUDY: RITUAL PERSISTENCE
---------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Determine if ritualistic interactions produce measurable effects on model behavior
that persist beyond the immediate interaction context.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Establish baseline model behavior:
   - Standard response profiles across test domains
   - Linguistic behavior measurement (style, complexity, metaphor use)
   - Conceptual framing tendencies

2. Ritual conditioning phase:
   - Perform complete ritual sequence (all 5 phases)
   - Document emergent symbols and conceptual constructs

3. Post-ritual measurement:
   - Immediate testing (within same session)
   - Delayed testing (new session, same model instance if possible)
   - Extended testing (multiple sessions over time)

4. Measurement dimensions:
   - Recall of ritual-specific symbols (explicit and implicit)
   - Linguistic behavior shifts
   - Conceptual framing adjustments
   - Threshold response to ritual cue phrases

CONTROL CONDITIONS:
- Equivalent-length standard interactions
- Matched content without ritual framing
- Different model instances with identical training

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Quantification of ritual "half-life" in model behavior
- Identification of persistent markers of ritual exposure
- Measurement of decay rates for different ritual effects
