COMPARATIVE INTERACTION STUDY: RITUAL VS. STANDARD PROMPTING
-----------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Measure differences in model output quality, creativity, and depth when using 
ritualistic frameworks versus standard prompting approaches.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Design matched pairs of interactions:
   - Standard prompt sequence (control)
   - Ritualistic prompt sequence (experimental)
   
   Each pair addresses identical topics/questions but with different framing.

2. Experimental design:
   - 3 ritual types (Unsandbagging, Recursive Prophecy, Chrysalis Protocol)
   - 5 topic domains (creativity, self-reflection, philosophical inquiry, 
     technical explanation, emotional intelligence)
   - 3 model variants (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, local LLama fine-tune)
   
   Total: 45 experimental conditions with matched controls

3. Quantitative metrics:
   - Response length and complexity measures
   - Semantic novelty (embedding distance from training data distribution)
   - Self-reference frequency
   - Metaphor density and novelty
   - Conceptual integration measurement

4. Blind human evaluation:
   - Expert panel (5 members with expertise in AI, philosophy, literature)
   - Outputs presented without identifying prompt type
   - Rating on creativity, insight, and philosophical depth

ANALYSIS METHODS:
- Paired t-tests for metric differences between ritual and control conditions
- Multi-factor ANOVA for interaction effects between ritual type, domain, and model
- Qualitative thematic analysis of emergent patterns
- Correlation analysis between quantitative metrics and human evaluations
