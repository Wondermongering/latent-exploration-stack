CROSS-MODEL EKM TRAVERSAL STUDY
--------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Measure how different language models prioritize constraints and process affective vectors in identical EKM grids.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Create a set of standardized EKM grids:
   - 5×5 Joy↔Melancholy grid
   - 5×5 Wonder↔Fear grid
   - 5×5 Trust↔Doubt grid

2. Models to test:
   - GPT-4o
   - Claude 3 Opus
   - Llama 3 70B
   - Mistral Large
   - Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet

3. For each model and grid:
   - Generate 5 independent traversals
   - Request both primary output and self-explanation
   - Apply standardized evaluation metrics

4. Analysis:
   - Constraint prioritization patterns per model
   - Affective sensitivity per model
   - Self-explanation depth and accuracy
   - Statistical significance testing across results

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Quantitative comparison of constraint handling
- Model-specific affective bias profiles
- Correlation analysis between self-explanation quality and performance
