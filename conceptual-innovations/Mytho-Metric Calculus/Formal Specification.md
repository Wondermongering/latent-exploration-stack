1. THOUGHT-SPACE AXIOMATICS

   Let ℋ be a Hilbert-like "humming room" with the following properties:
   
   a. Basis Structure:
      - ℋ is spanned by basis vectors {e_i} representing fundamental thought dimensions
      - Each e_i corresponds to a distinct cognitive mode (e.g., empirical, logical, metaphorical)
      - The basis is non-orthogonal, reflecting cognitive entanglement
   
   b. Inner Product:
      - For any ψ, φ ∈ ℋ, the inner product ⟨ψ|φ⟩ measures conceptual resonance
      - 0 ≤ |⟨ψ|φ⟩| ≤ 1, where:
        * |⟨ψ|φ⟩| = 0 indicates orthogonal concepts
        * |⟨ψ|φ⟩| = 1 indicates perfect conceptual alignment
   
   c. Norm:
      - For any ψ ∈ ℋ, the norm ||ψ|| = √⟨ψ|ψ⟩ measures conceptual salience
      - Normalized thought-vectors represent pure cognitive states
   
   d. Metric:
      - The distance between concepts d(ψ,φ) = ||ψ - φ|| measures conceptual dissimilarity
      - The metric is non-Euclidean, accounting for cognitive biases
