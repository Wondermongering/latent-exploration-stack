VECTOR SPACE MODELING EXPERIMENT
--------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Demonstrate that the perichorēsis operator produces measurable and meaningful
transformations in semantic embedding space.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Data preparation:
   - Create embeddings for exemplar texts in each thread category
   - Establish baseline centroids for each thread

2. Operator implementation:
   - Implement perichorēsis operator in embedding space
   - Create transformed embeddings using different thread combinations

3. Measurement protocols:
   - Cosine similarity analysis between original and transformed spaces
   - Principal component analysis of transformed spaces
   - Cluster analysis of emergent concepts

4. Control comparisons:
   - Simple vector addition (a + b)
   - Vector averaging ((a + b)/2)
   - Random interpolation

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Demonstration that perichorēsis produces semantically rich spaces
  beyond simple addition or averaging
- Identification of emergent concepts at the boundaries of combined spaces
- Validation of theoretical properties (dimensional expansion, harmony/tension)
