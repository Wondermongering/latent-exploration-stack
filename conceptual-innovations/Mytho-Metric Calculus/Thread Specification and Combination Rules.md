EPISTEMIC THREADS

   a. Thread Definition:
      An epistemic thread T_i is a coherent subspace of ℋ characterized by:
      - A central concept vector c_i
      - A covariance structure Σ_i defining conceptual spread
      - A set of exemplar vectors {e_ij} that span the thread
   
   b. Thread Catalog:
      T₁: Empirical Claim - Observational anchoring in reality
      T₂: Logical Deduction - Inferential rule-based reasoning
      T₃: Theoretical Postulate - Generalizing framework construction
      T₄: Metaphysical Speculation - Boundary-transcendent conjecture
      T₅: Heuristic Guideline - Pragmatic operational principle
      T₆: Personal Reflection - Subjective experiential integration
      T₇: Cross-Cultural Analogue - Comparative pattern recognition
   
   c. Thread Combination Rules:
      - Sequential combination: ((T₁ ⇆ T₂) ⇆ T₃) ⇆ ... ⇆ T₇
      - Thread coupling strength: κ(T_i, T_j) = |⟨c_i|c_j⟩|
      - Emergent dimensionality: dim(⇆_{i=1}^n T_i) = f(n, {κ(T_i, T_j)})
