COGNITIVE IMPACT STUDY
----------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Measure how exposure to mytho-metric transformed content affects human
creativity, problem-solving, and conceptual thinking.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Participant selection:
   - 60-80 participants with diverse backgrounds
   - Control for creative thinking baseline (Torrance Tests)

2. Experimental design:
   - 2x2 factorial design (ordinary vs. transformed content) Ã— (simple vs. complex problem)
   - Within-subjects measurement for learning effects

3. Test materials:
   - Problem set A: Standard presentation
   - Problem set B: Mytho-metric transformed presentation
     (using specified thread combinations)

4. Measurement instruments:
   - Creative output assessment (blind expert rating)
   - Conceptual integration measures
   - Self-reported insight experience
   - Solution quality and originality metrics

ANALYSIS METHODS:
- MANOVA for multidimensional effect analysis
- Mediation analysis for insight mechanism
- Qualitative coding of creative outputs
- Correlation with baseline creative measures

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- Significant increase in conceptual integration
- Higher originality scores in solutions
- Increased cross-domain analogical thinking
- Self-reported "aha" moments during problem-solving
