PREDICTIVE MODELING FRAMEWORK
----------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Create a predictable, testable model of how specific thread combinations
produce specific types of conceptual transformations.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Baseline establishment:
   - Map thread combinations to semantic transformations
   - Create prediction models for thread interactions
   
2. Validation data:
   - Generate a corpus of thread combinations and their outputs
   - Human annotation of output characteristics
   
3. Model training:
   - Supervised learning of transformation patterns
   - Feature extraction from combination parameters
   
4. Testing protocol:
   - Cross-validation with held-out combinations
   - Blind prediction of emergent concepts

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Mathematical model that predicts emergent concepts from thread parameters
- Quantitative measures of prediction accuracy
- Identification of high-leverage thread combinations
