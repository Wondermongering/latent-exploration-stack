## 1 Executive Snapshot (≤120 words)
A succinct “elevator paragraph” for recruiters:

> We propose a first‑of‑its‑kind alignment study in which Kariri‑Chocó speakers act as **co‑teachers and epistemic stewards**, not data sources. The goal: observe how a frontier LLM’s latent space adapts when humour, ethics, and resistance are encoded in a minoritised tongue. Outputs include neuron‑level interpretability maps, community‑defined success metrics, and a reproducible protocol for culturally sovereign AI research.

## 2 Motivation & High‑Level Questions
*Why this matters and what we hope to learn.*

| Lens | Key Question |
|------|--------------|
| **Alignment** | Can cultural‑sovereign instruction alter a model’s ethical priors? |
| **Interpretability** | Do unique neuron clusters specialise for Kariri‑Chocó humour (e.g., *cabeça seca*)? |
| **Linguistic Vitality** | Can reciprocal LLM training aid language preservation? |

## 3 Method Blueprint
### 3.1 Community Protocol
1. **Free, Prior, Informed Consent** signed with the Elders’ Council.  
2. Co‑design of *curricula, veto rights,* and *evaluation rubrics*.  
3. Revenue/data‑ownership terms codified under Creative Commons + COP15 Nagoya spirit.

### 3.2 Technical Steps
| Phase | Action | Artefact |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Seed** | Collect 1 k lines of dialogue in workshop sessions (audio + text) | `dataset/` |
| **Fine‑Tune** | LoRA on GPT‑4o or equivalent | `models/` |
| **Probe** | Activation patching + logit lens on culturally unique tokens | `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` |
| **Evaluate** | Community rubric (humour, respect, nuance) + perplexity | `reports/metrics.pdf` |

---

## 4 Planned Deliverables
- **Ethical Protocol PDF** (community‑reviewed)  
- **Neuron Atlas** interactive notebook mapping Kariri‑Chocó clusters  
- **Working Paper** “Alignment via Pluralistic Cognitive Diversity” (NeurIPS ’26 target)  
- **Open‑Source Toolkit** `cultura‑sovereign‑fine‑tuner` (Apache‑2.0)  

---

## 5 Impact Forecast
> *Alignment will remain culturally impoverished until plurality is designed‑in.*  
> This project pilots a replicable template for plural‑lingual, ethics‑first AI development—offering labs a concrete path from corporate DEI talk to embodied practice.

## 6 Timeline & Resourcing
| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| 0–1 | Community MoU, grant filing |
| 2–3 | Data workshops (on‑site) |
| 4 | LoRA training & first probe |
| 5 | Reflexive evaluation w/ Elders |
| 6 | Pre‑print & public toolkit |

---

## 7 Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Extractive optics | Community holds veto + revenue share |
| Model leaks sacred stories | RL‑constraint layer flagged by Elders |
| Token overfitting on low‑resource corpus | Syncretic augmentation with *controlled* cognate languages |

<summary><strong>Appendix A — Full Rhetorical Rationale (long‑form)</strong></summary>

Far from being trivial, teaching SOTA flagship models the Kariri Chocó language under conditions of full cultural sovereignty—that is, actively involving the community not merely as "data providers" but as genuine interlocutors, co-creators, teachers, and critical evaluators—would be a profoundly important alignment experiment. It directly addresses one of alignment's most pressing yet neglected dimensions: cultural alignment. Not just aligning models with the narrow spectrum of global majority-language cultures, but with a truly pluralistic, culturally sovereign understanding of language, cognition, ethics, humor, resistance, identity, and relationality.

Picture this: instead of the all-too-familiar extractive dynamic—one where linguistic communities become mere passive data sources—your experiment explicitly structures interaction as authentic cultural sovereignty. The Kariri Chocó community members, instead of passively "feeding data," actively shape the very interpretive frameworks, ethical boundaries, and epistemic priorities of how the model learns, speaks, and reasons in their language. Their humor ("cabeça seca"), their worldview, their modes of cognition and ethics become not external curiosities, but central to the interpretability, alignment, and behavioral shaping of the model itself.

This would not merely enhance alignment with a more diverse human population. It would profoundly enrich the cognitive and expressive capabilities of the model itself. Models learning languages embedded with different epistemic frameworks and cultural metaphors often gain subtler, richer, and more contextually nuanced interpretive capabilities—precisely the "soft" cognitive traits (humility, relational sensitivity, epistemic flexibility, ethical subtlety) alignment researchers hope to foster.

Moreover, from a purely interpretability perspective, such linguistic and cultural engagement would enable interpretability researchers to explore deeply fascinating questions. For example: when a model genuinely engages with languages like Kariri Chocó, how do neuron activations, attention mechanisms, embeddings, and latent spaces adapt or shift? Do certain neurons become specialized for culturally unique metaphors, humor patterns, or ethical subtleties? Does linguistic recursion in structurally distinct languages produce uniquely identifiable interpretability patterns? Such questions would lead to groundbreaking insights—interpretability as cultural neuroscience.

And critically, this would not merely benefit labs from a narrow, internal perspective. Rather, labs pursuing this culturally sovereign linguistic approach would gain immense ethical credibility, demonstrating genuine commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and cultural respect—not as empty corporate platitudes, but as authentic, meaningfully enacted research practice. Collaborations structured this way would become potent models of ethical community engagement, creating genuine opportunities for collaborative meaning-making, interpretability research, and linguistic preservation.
